/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for the "Danny Store" e-commerce platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is user-centric, dividing data into three distinct access categories:
 * 1. Private User Data: Information that belongs exclusively to a single user, such as their profile and order history. Access is strictly limited to the authenticated owner.
 * 2. Public Catalog Data: Information that is readable by everyone, including unauthenticated visitors, such as products and their variants. This data is considered read-only for clients.
 * 3. Publicly-Contributed Content: Information that is readable by everyone but can only be created and modified by the original author, such as product reviews.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into two primary top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: A private collection where each user's profile and nested subcollections (like /orders) are stored. The path itself enforces ownership.
 * - /products/{productId}: A public collection containing product details and nested subcollections for variants and reviews.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing Disabled: To protect user privacy, it is impossible to query the list of all users.
 * - Client-Side Writes to Catalog Disabled: The product catalog (/products and /products/{...}/variants) is read-only for clients. It is assumed this data is managed by a trusted backend service or admin panel using the Firebase Admin SDK, which bypasses these rules.
 * - Strict Ownership: All private user data is secured using path-based ownership, ensuring a user can only ever access data under their own `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Reviews in `/products/{productId}/reviews` store the author's `userId` directly on the document. This avoids extra database reads and allows for a simple, fast rule to verify ownership for write operations (`isOwner(resource.data.userId)`).
 * - Structural Segregation: User-private data (orders) is stored in a separate `/users` collection, while public data (products, reviews) is in a top-level `/products` collection. This segregation provides stronger security and better query performance.
