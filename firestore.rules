/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data,
 * such as user profiles and orders, while allowing public read access to shared catalog
 * data like products and reviews. The primary goal is to ensure that a user can only
 * access and manage their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into a mix of top-level public collections
 * and user-specific private subcollections.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Contains private user data and serves as the root for other
 *   user-owned documents like orders.
 * - `/products`, `/productVariants`, `/reviews`: Top-level collections for data that
 *   is publicly readable. Writes to these collections are either restricted to owners
 *   (reviews) or disabled for clients (products).
 * - `/users/{userId}/orders`: A subcollection where each user's private order history
 *   is stored, ensuring path-based security.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only ever interact with documents under their own
 *   `/users/{userId}` path. They cannot read or write to another user's data.
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing documents from the top-level `/users` collection is
 *   explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Catalog, Controlled Writes: Products and their variants are publicly readable
 *   by anyone but are not writable by clients, under the assumption that they are managed
 *   by a trusted backend or admin service.
 * - Owner-Only Review Management: Any signed-in user can create a review, but only the
 *   original author of a review can update or delete it. This is managed by a `userId`
 *   field on each review document.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules for `/reviews` depend on a denormalized `userId` field on each review
 *   document to verify ownership for update and delete operations without needing extra
 *   database reads.
 * - The rules for `/users/{userId}/orders` use the `userId` from the path to enforce
 *   ownership, which is efficient and secure.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private data (orders) is segregated into a user-specific subcollection
 *   (`/users/{userId}/orders`) rather than a single top-level `/orders` collection.
 *   This makes it impossible for a user to query or access another user's orders and
 *   simplifies the security rules.
